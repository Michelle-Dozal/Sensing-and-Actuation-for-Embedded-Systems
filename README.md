# Sensing-and-Actuation-for-Embedded-Systems
>These projects are the labs that were completed while taking EE128 at University of California, Riverside in Spring 2021 with Dr. Roman Chomko. The main purpose of the labs was to become familiar and comfortable using C to design motor interface principles: analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion, Nyquist, and power constraints; and, design principles for instrumentation, embedded software, and real-time systems

## General
The main purpose of these labs was to implement real-time systems based around the **ARM K64F** development board and the **Arduino Uno** board.

Implemented Things like
* Bi-directional, binary counter & an 8-bit, bi-directional, one-hot rotator.
* Interrupt-driven two-digit display for bi-directional counter and ADC output 
* Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) signal using the Arduino board, and drive an LED with the PWM signal.


### Includes
* Lab 1: Software Configuration and Simple Parallel I/O
* Lab 2: Interrupt Handling and ADC
* Lab 3: Timer and PWM Operations


#### Some Showcases 
*Lab1: Circuit Board*
